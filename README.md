ProjFormatter is an open source CLI tool for formatting *proj files such as vcxproj, csproj, vcxproj.filters.
It works by either receiving a proj path and formatting that file or by receiving an sln path and formatting all proj files references in it.
In the future it may be availalbe as a visual studio extension.
